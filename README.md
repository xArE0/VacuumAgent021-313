## Project Overview

This repository contains implementations of three types of vacuum cleaner agents in Python, designed to operate within a virtual room environment with randomly generated dirt:

- **Goal-Based Agent:** Uses memory and goal-testing to clean the environment efficiently.
- **Simple Reflex Agent:** Acts based solely on the current state of the environment without memory.
- **Utility-Based Agent:** Selects actions based on a utility function to balance cleaning and exploration.

Each agent navigates a 2D grid room, detects dirt, and cleans it by moving intelligently around the space.
